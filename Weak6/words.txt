More than 11,000 COVID-19 confirmed and asymptomatic cases have been discharged and released from medical observation as of Saturday since the current outbreak began in early March, the Shanghai government said on Sunday.

"Residential neighborhood committees must ensure that the recovered patients reach home without disruptions from neighbors and supervise them to follow seven-day self-health monitoring at home," Wu Qianyu, a primary inspector from the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said at a municipal news briefing.

There has been no case in Shanghai of a recovered patient still transmitting the novel coronavirus, said Wu Jinglei, director of the commission, on Saturday.

Shanghai initiated a new round of citywide nucleic acid tests on Saturday and plans to complete it on Sunday. Based on test results, the city will manage different areas based on their risk levels.

"We should rule out the slightest slack in our work at the moment. We must continue to control personnel flow, stop the spread of the epidemic, and achieve zero cases as soon as possible," said Wu Qianyu.

The municipality recorded 24,943 COVID-19 local infections, including 1,006 confirmed cases, on Saturday, a record high after days of continuous climb.

Also, the daily number of newly reported infections in the city has surpassed 20,000 for three consecutive days.

Shanghai entered the 10th day of a citywide lockdown on Sunday to contain its worst COVID-19 local outbreak. Regions east of the Huangpu River have been locked down since March 28.
